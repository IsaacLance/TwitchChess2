# Twitch Plays Chess
### CIS 330 project by Justin Robles and Isaac Lance

## Requirements
Python 3
Selenium
Chromedriver (included in repo)
Twitch API

## Project Goals
We want to be able to create a livesteam on twitch of chess.com where users can input commands into the chat to vote on the next move. This will be done using Python and C++ in tandem where Python will be used to make the pieces move and C++ will be used to read the chat inputs and tell python where to move pieces.
