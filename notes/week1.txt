Justin Update:
The first week I wanted to simply test selenium and do some research on how to use Python to make on chess.com. What I found is that I will need to send mouse movements and clicks to the webpage to simulate a users input. This should not be too hard to do since all I need to know is where the chess board begins and I can select and square on the board. Once I am able to do that I am going to create a class that can make any moves given and a driver program to run it. The driver program will simply wait for the C++ program to tell it what to do. I did not have a lot of time this past week to work on this project but this week I will be able to put a lot of time into it.
