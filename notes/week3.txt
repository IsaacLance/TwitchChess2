This week I was able to add to my test script to make it able to click the board in order to move pieces. Over the next few days I am going to work on making a function that will be able to output the correct coordinates of the squares when input is given. The input will be something like A5 to B5. I know this seems like a small step since last week but I really wanted to make sure all the little pieces of my part would work correctly before putting it all together and now I almost have everything I need. The next step after completing this python script would be to start the c++ code that will use the python script. Last week I said we would use python running the whole time and call C++ but after meeting with Isaac we decided to do the opposite (Using C++ constantly running calling Python). If you would like to see what this is doing I added a makefile. Then run it will log into our account, start a game with a computer and then will ask for input of a move (Which does nothing as of writing this). Input anything into the console and it will click the bottom left board piece.
