Week 2:

This week I spent most of my time trying out what library to use to connect Python and C++ and what would be the best way to approach it. I tried a few ways that didn't work in the end so I did not include them in the repo. I finally tested out Cython and found it should be able to do everything we want it to do. I made a very simple little program that can call a c++ function using python that I will push to the repo now. What our current plan is is we will have python as our main driver which will be running throughout the stream. Its main purpose is to make the moves on the webpage. It will receive information from C++ and then make the move it is told to make. I think that by the end of this current week we should have a somewhat working prototype. Up until this point we have been making small test programs to prove that it will work. Isaac has been working on writing code based on http://www.the-tech-tutorial.com/simple-c-irc-bot-template/ and will push his work soon.
